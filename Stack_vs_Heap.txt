1. stack memory is used to store local variables and function call
heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

2. Each thread in Java has their own stack, heap is for java program

3. If there is no memory left in the stack, java throws java.lang.stackoverflowerror
if there is no heap space for creating objects, java throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

4. Using recursion(function call itself) will cause stackoverflow, as it will fill up stack memory.

5. Stack meomry is a lot less than the size of heap memory

6. Variables stored in stacks are only visible to owner thread
objects created in heap are visible to all threads.
Stack memory is private, Heap memory is shared among all threads
